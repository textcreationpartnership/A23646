            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe Noble Lord Chancellour, in his excellent Speech, <hi>May,</hi> 1662. calls to minde the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent temper of the Time of Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth;</hi> the bleſſed Condeſcention and Reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the People then to the Crown; the awful Reverence they had then to the Governours and Government both of Church and State: And we may better remember the ſweet times of King <hi>James,</hi> when we went all together to the Houſe of God as Friends. Now to reduce the People to their ancient ſweet temper, muſt be the work of God; and under him we have no hopes but onely in the great Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of his Majeſty and this Noble Parliament. His Majeſty hath done ſo much already, as if he had ſtudied to do for this Nation, what a <hi>Roman Caeſar</hi> ſaid of his City, <hi>Marmoream ſe relinquere, quam lateritiam accepiſſet.</hi> (Suet.)

The famous Parliament of <hi>Paris</hi> told their King once, <hi>That the onely way to extirpate Hereſie, Schiſm,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>was firſt to reform their own Church after the example of the Primitive, who reſiſted He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie with Preaching the Word of God.</hi> The Church of <hi>England</hi> is of an excellent Conſtitution; if all her Members were of as good a Complexion, her Beauty would allure many Thouſands to return to her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, that now are gone aſtray. The Doctrine of our Church is pure, her Diſcipline good; neither of theſe ſo much as our vicious Lives, that opens the mouths of our Adverſaries ſo wide againſt us. There be other Crimes more heinous in their own guilt, but <hi>Drunkenneſs</hi> is the greateſt Eye-ſore: If that beaſtly Vice were ſuppreſt, our Adverſaries could have nothing to ſay, but what we can well anſwer and ſtop their mouths. Falſe Brethren have always done more miſchief, than profeſt Enemies. This preſent Diſcourſe I was provoked to by the Challenge of a Learned Frier, and humbly preſent it to your Honours grave Judgment.

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>A <hi>Moſt Noble King of this Nation was of opinion,</hi> That Diſcord among Subjects did alienate their minds, not only one from another, but alſo from their Prince; inſomuch that the Bond of Unity, Peace, and Love, could never hold long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Prince and his People, if the People were at diſcord among themſelves. <hi>Moreover,</hi> That the cauſe of Difference among People, aroſe chiefly from difference in Religion; and that difference in Religion was fomented with nothing ſo much, as with names of Faction. <hi>Hereto aſſenteth a Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Remonſtrant,</hi> Groninchaev. <hi>who ſaith,</hi> That names of Faction were the Devils de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and ſerved to no other end, but to make and maintain Diviſion. <hi>And hereof it ſeems his Majeſty was very ſenſible, as appears in his gracious</hi> Act of Oblivion. <hi>There is a neceſſity of Names for diſtinction ſake, to avoid Confuſion; but the miſchief is, when Names or Titles are given and
<pb facs="tcp:93280:6"/>
taken falſly, to blaſt the reputation of ſome, and make them odious to the world; and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance others in the opinion of the world, with Names and Titles that no ways belong unto them; ſo that the world is meerly cheated with vain Words, falſe Names and Titles without Truth, falſely impoſed on Perſons and things; as I ſhall endeavour to ſhew in theſe following particulars.</hi>

               </head>
               <p>THis barbarous word hath been the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of much Idolatry, and the cauſe of many Troubles in the World; and I am engaged to take notice of it in in the firſt place upon this occaſion. A Perſon of Honour told me, That my Hiſtory of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> ſhould be anſwered. After two years, a learned Friar ſends me a Book called <hi>An Anſwer;</hi> wherein he chargeth our famous Church and Nation with Perjury, for abjuring <hi>Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation,</hi> in ſubſcribing a Declaration ſet forth to that purpoſe, by Authority of his Majeſty and the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; requiring of me a Reply. My Reply is, <hi>That the very firſt words of his Book are a notorious un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth, as all the Nation can witneſs; and but little truth in the reſt, ſave in two or three places, where the poor</hi> Infidel <hi>confeſſeth his Ignorance of the true
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:93280:7"/>
Faith, and ſome other things that every School-boy knows.</hi> A full Reply I ſhall give him in four Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That</hi> Tranſubſtantiation <hi>was never heard of, or known in the Church, till above</hi> 1000 <hi>years after Chriſt, neither name nor thing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That it was never generally received by Learned</hi> Papiſts <hi>themſelves, till the</hi> Council <hi>of</hi> Trent.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>That their Grounds and Reaſons for it, are too weak to ſupport it, and that monſtrous weight of Doubts and Difficulties that depend upon it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>That the Doctrine of the Church of</hi> England <hi>in this point, is moſt agreeable to</hi> Holy Scriptures, <hi>and to all pure Antiquity, and may be called</hi> Tranſmuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p n="1">I. To the firſt, the Frier ſaith, It was ever known and believed in the Church, <hi>quoad rem,</hi> though not <hi>quoad nomen: (i. e.)</hi> by certain equivalent terms; and for that cites Five <hi>Fathers,</hi> all rejected for ſpurious by their own Learned Men. His equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent Terms are, <hi>Mutatio, Tranſmutatio, Tranſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lementatio:</hi> the two firſt we admit in the ſame ſenſe that the Fathers uſed them; the laſt is a change, <hi>Etiam ad materiam primam,</hi> ſaith a famous School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and will not ſerve his turn. There be other terms uſed by the Fathers, that will do him as little good; but I ſhall take no notice of more than he ſends me.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anno</hi> 850.] About this time lived <hi>Bertram</hi> a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Preſbyter, who in his Book <hi>De Corp. &amp; Sang. Chriſti,</hi> ſaith, <hi>That according to their ſubſtance the Bread and Wine remain in the Sacrament, after Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration.</hi> The bold Frier calls this <hi>an Impertinency,</hi> when the whole Univerſity of <hi>Doway,</hi> in their cenſure of it, could neither deny the Book, nor anſwer it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno</hi> 1057.] About this time lived <hi>Berengarius,</hi> Archdeacon of <hi>Anjou,</hi> who denied <hi>Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Pope <hi>Nicholas</hi> 2. <hi>Concil. Lateran.</hi> 2. made him recant and make this publick Confeſſion, <hi>That the very Body and Blood of Chriſt, in the Sacrament, was truely and ſenſually broken and bruiſed in pieces with the teeth of the Faithful;</hi> and this Confeſſion the Pope and Council allowed for Catholick. Our bold Friar ſaith it is falſe; I ſhall prove him a Liar preſently. For this Confeſſion is recorded by <hi>Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard. l.</hi> 4. <hi>diſt.</hi> 12. <hi>D.</hi> and <hi>De Conſer. diſt.</hi> 2. <hi>Ca. Ego Berengarius.</hi> And their own <hi>Carranza</hi> teſtifies, That the Pope did force and compel him to it: And that it was allowed for <hi>Catholick</hi> by Pope and Council, appears clearly; becauſe <hi>Lanfranc</hi> of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury,</hi> who ſate in that Council, ſharply rebukes <hi>Berengarius</hi> for recanting that Confeſſion, as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he did. This Confeſſion was as near the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:93280:8"/>
                  <hi>Capernaites</hi> as could well be. But where is now our bold Friars <hi>Catholick</hi> ſenſe of the Church for <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation?</hi> Here is no appearance of it, name or thing, according to the Friars own terms.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno</hi> 1150.] About this time lived <hi>Peter Lombard,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Paris,</hi> the likelieſt man alive to know the <hi>Catholic</hi> ſenſe of the Church; becauſe he made it his ſtudy and buſineſs to ſearch the Fathers, and col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect Sentences out of their Writings; and yet he ſaith (<hi>l.</hi> 4. <hi>diſt.</hi> 11. A) <hi>Si autem quaeritur,</hi> &amp;c. If it be demanded, what manner of Converſion is in the Sacrament, or of what kind, <hi>Definire non ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio:</hi> I am not able (ſaith he) to determine. We ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg a Converſion as well as they; but if <hi>Lombard,</hi> in all his reading, could not learn what manner of Converſion it was; then it may be the ſame that we allow, and the <hi>Fathers</hi> underſtood no other.</p>
               <p n="2">II. My ſecond Aſſertion is, That <hi>Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> was never generally received by Learned <hi>Papiſts</hi> themſelves, till the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi> For their moſt eminent <hi>School-men</hi> (ſome of them Cardinals) ſay, <hi>That they receive it out of reverence to the Church, becauſe ſhe hath ſo decreed; but otherwiſe in their own judgment, rather approve that Opinion which ſaith, That the ſubſtance of Bread and Wine remains in the Sacrament, as moſt agreeable to holy Scripture and right Reaſon; and that</hi> Tranſubſtantiation <hi>was a raſh Opinion, having no ground in Scripture.</hi> This was the more common Opinion of the <hi>Schoolmen</hi> for above 200 years. The Friar ſaith, I wrong the Doctors, and will prove it; I know not when. But let him unmaſk himſelf, that I may ſee the right
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:93280:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
face, and then I ſhall return him his own challenge, and let him put it to trial when he dares.</p>
               <p n="3">III. My third Aſſertion is, That their own Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons or Grounds for <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> are too weak to ſupport it, and the monſtrous weight of Doubts and Difficulties that depend upon it. Their general ground is the power and truth of Chriſt, God Almighty, who made all the world by his word; hence they infer Poſſibility, Verity, Neceſſity. The Anſwer is, that an Argument from the Creation, is but <hi>à particulari ad particulare,</hi> and holds not; nor <hi>à poſſe ad eſſe,</hi> from Poſſibility to Verity: as to ſay, It may be ſo, therefore it is ſo; or, God can do this and that, therefore he doth it, or it is done; all ſuch Arguments are inconſequent, irrational, and ridiculous. An Argument may well follow from the Will of God to his Power, but not from his Power to his Will. Particular Reaſons or Grounds they have.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Time when Chriſt ſpake the words; <hi>a time</hi> (ſay they) <hi>when all Figures were ended;</hi> but that is apparently falſe: for there is a plain Figure in the Cup, which they neither deny nor can avoid.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Some argue thus; <hi>The Bread which Chriſt gave in his laſt Supper, came down from Heaven; But Bakers bread came not down from Heaven; therefore he gave not Bakers bread, but the ſubſtance of his own Body.</hi> It is retorted thus; The ſubſtance of Chriſt his natural Body was taken of the B. Virgin, and came not down from Heaven: But the bread which Chriſt gave came down from Heaven: Therefore the Bread which Chriſt gave, was not the ſubſtance of his natural Body. Conſidering the weakneſs of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:93280:9"/>
their Argument, and inconvenience of the retort, they fly to other grounds; as</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>To</hi> Ubiquity, <hi>through Perſonal <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion of both Natures:</hi> But this overthrows the grounds of their own aſſertion. For as they handle the matter, their <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>biquity</hi> is not <hi>ubique,</hi> (good Mr. Frier.) But the direct anſwer is this; Although both Natures are united in one Perſon, yet the eſſential properties of either are reſerved to each nature, and not communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated. So that as Chriſt God-man died, but not the Godhead; ſo alſo Chriſt God-man is every where, but not the Manhood. That follows in <hi>Concreto,</hi> which does not follow in <hi>Abſtracto.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Another ground for <hi>Corporal Preſence,</hi> is our Incorporation into Chriſt, Epheſ. 5.30. <hi>We are Members of his Body, fleſh and bones:</hi> and 1 Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth. 10.16. <hi>The breaking of bread is the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Body of Chriſt.</hi> By corporal preſence. But it is <hi>Communio,</hi> not <hi>Commixtio,</hi> as their own Learned ſay; and <hi>Communio effectivè operans,</hi> not needing <hi>Corporal preſence,</hi> but only the preſence of a Supernatural, Sacramental Grace, Power, and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue from his Body. Our Saviour's words are plain to this purpoſe, Joh. 6.35. <hi>He that believeth in me, ſhall never thirſt,</hi> never hunger, but be ſatisfied with my body and blood by Faith in believing. And (ver. 56.) <hi>He that eateth my fleſh,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>dwelleth in me, and I in him:</hi> What manner of dwelling it is, the Apoſtle tells you, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.17. Chriſt dwells in our hearts by Faith. And ſure the Apoſtle knew the minde of Chriſt better than all the Friers in the world.</p>
               <p n="5">5. They have another Argument, <hi>From the long
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:93280:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
continuance of their Doctrine in the Church, ever ſince the Apoſtles time.</hi> It hath been diſproved al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, and proved, That the Church in all Ages taught the contrary, till a few years before our age. Another Argument they have from the promiſe of Chriſt, <hi>To keep his Church from errour.</hi> The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is true, and holds good; but their Argument ſo vain, that I will not ſpend Paper about it.</p>
               <p>Now the Doubts, Difficulties, and Abſurdities that accompany <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> are, <hi>Locatum ſine loco; Quantum ſine quantitate,</hi> &amp;c. In a place, poſſeſſing no place; a body without quantity, or other acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents; and accidents ſubſiſting of themſelves, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a body or ſubject. Fraction, or breaking in the Sacrament, and yet nothing broken, but only in ſhew or appearance. And the Apoſtle calls it breaking of Bread, becauſe it ſeems ſo to the eye. If there be any Jugglers in the world, theſe are plain Jugglers, who caſt a miſt of ſenſeleſs words before mens eyes, to make them believe they ſee that, which is not. The Frier profeſſeth to keep cloſe to our Saviour's words; but where then doth our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ſay, <hi>This is my ſpiritualized Body;</hi> or, <hi>This is a Spirit?</hi> Or, <hi>This is my body under the ſpecies of bread?</hi> Or where doth St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſay, <hi>The ſpecies of bread which we break?</hi> &amp;c. The Frier may be aſhamed of theſe ſhifts. I deſire the Reader to take notice of Three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That <hi>Species,</hi> a word uſed by the Fathers, is taken by them for ſubſtance of bread, and is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly taken ſo at this day, for ſubſtance, eſpecially by Phyſicians.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To <hi>Conſecrate</hi> never ſignified to <hi>Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate,</hi>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:93280:10"/>
but only to dedicate a common thing to a ſacred uſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is an uſual manner of Speech in Scripture, when it ſpeaks of Sacraments, to call the Sign by the name of the thing ſignified.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. My Fourth and laſt Aſſertion is, That the Doctrine of the Sacrament held by the Church of <hi>England,</hi> is moſt agreeable to Holy Scripture and to all pure Antiquity. We may call it <hi>Tranſmutation,</hi> a word found often in old Writers, and alloweth a change great and marvellous, not in ſubſtance, but in Vertue, Power and Operation. There muſt be a wonderful Change, elſe there could not follow ſuch a powerful Operation: But this change is not in ſubſtance, for that remains ſtill unchanged. For proof whereof, I refer the Frier to the uſual Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Fathers againſt the <hi>Eutychian</hi> Hereticks, and from thence downward to all Learned Writers, even their own beſt Doctors; let him ſearch and ſee. We acknowledge, that the very Body and Bloud of Chriſt are in the Sacrament, truely received, truely eaten, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We contend not about the matter, but the manner; we receive the very Body of Chriſt by Faith, in a Spiritual divine manner. The Frier promiſeth to give my little Hiſtory another broad ſide; but to ſave a labour, he fairly yields the cauſe, (<hi>pag.</hi> 10. of his Book) in theſe words: <hi>His natural Body to eat in a ſpiritual divine manner;</hi> and (<hi>pag.</hi> 9.) <hi>His true body exiſting in a ſpirtual divine manner;</hi> and ſo I hope we ſhall agree at laſt.</p>

               <p>THis Opinion alſo hath been the occaſion of much Superſtition, and cauſe of much Trouble, eſpecially in <hi>Germany,</hi> upon this occaſion. <hi>Zuinglius</hi> obſerving how near the Decree of Pope <hi>Nicholas,</hi> and his Council of <hi>Lateran,</hi> drew to the <hi>Capernaites;</hi> he withdrew as much to the other ſide, ſhewing his Arguments to one <hi>Caroloſtadius.

               <p>THis glorious Title makes a great gap in our Nation, and many thouſands are dazled and drawn away with the ſplendour of it, meerly for want of a right underſtanding. For this title doth no way belong to thoſe that appropriate the ſame to themſelves, but moſt properly to <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> eſpecially of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> For St. <hi>Paul</hi> was the firſt Founder of the Church at <hi>Rome,</hi> where he planted the Chriſtian Faith, once famous all the world over, Rom. 1.8. <hi>Spoken of throughout the world,</hi> and that was Catholick enough. Now this very ſame <hi>Catholick Faith</hi> that St. <hi>Paul</hi> taught the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> we of the Church of <hi>England</hi> teach and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs to a ſyllable; let St. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf in all his holy Epiſtles be our Judge: And therefore we are the true <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks, and not they that have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted the true <hi>Roman</hi> Faith. The common talk of St. <hi>Peters</hi> Chair at <hi>Rome,</hi> where they ſay he ſate as Biſhop twenty five years, are but vain words with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out proof. For what ſhould St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Chair do in St. <hi>Paul's</hi> Church, planted by him? to whom was committed the Goſpel of the Uncircumciſion, as the Goſpel of the Circumciſion was unto <hi>Peter,</hi> Galat. 2. and thereupon they were agreed; and <hi>verſ.</hi> 9. St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:93280:11"/>
gave St. <hi>Paul</hi> the right hand of fellowſhip, that he ſhould go to the Gentiles. Now if St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſet his Chair at <hi>Rome,</hi> it was contrary to his own cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant or agreement. Or (2.) If St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Headſhip is ſo neceſſary a point of the Faith, for the good of the univerſal Church, ſure our Saviour would have ſpoken of it in more ſolemn plain words. Or, (3.) St. <hi>Paul</hi> in his Salutations or Greetings ſent to the Saints at <hi>Rome,</hi> would ſurely have remembred the chief Paſtor, if there had been any ſuch; or if St. <hi>Peter</hi> had been the man. Or, (4.) If St. <hi>Peter</hi> was ordained Univerſal Paſtor and Head of the Church, St. <hi>Paul</hi> did not well to take upon him the care of all the Churches, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.28. when that belongs to the chief Paſtour; except they will ſay, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> was St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Curate. However, it is not the Chair, but the Doctrine; nor a ſucceſſion of perſons, but truth of Doctrine, that makes a true Church. People are then much miſtaken, to call <hi>Popery</hi> the old Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, when the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion is the moſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, clearly founded in Holy Scripture; and the other but new, not to be found in Holy Scripture, nor in any Record of pure Antiquity. So that we have no difference with the true Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but with a prevailing Party or Faction, called in our Laws, not <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> but <hi>Popiſh Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants.</hi>

               </head>
               <p>
                  <hi>TRadition</hi> is a Monſter that lives meerly by Air. Our learned Frier calls it, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncontrollable Tradition.</hi> If he takes it for the manner of delivery, called <hi>Oral Tradition;</hi> or for the matter delivered, called, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nwritten Verities;</hi> they are both control<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable, and controlled by daily Experience, and found guilty of falſhood. The Council of <hi>Trent</hi> it ſelf hath overthrown <hi>Tradition,</hi> with their too much zeal to eſtabliſh it: For by joyning it with Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, inſtead of building it up, they caſt it down; becauſe <hi>Tradition</hi> is no more able to ſtand with Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture, than <hi>Dagon</hi> before the Ark of God. Hereof a learned <hi>Carmelite,</hi> preſent in that Council, gave them warning; adviſing them to conſider firſt, Whether the Chriſtian Doctrine hath two parts, one written by the Will of God, the other forbidden to be written, but only to be taught by word of mouth: or whether in the whole body of Chriſtian Doctrine, it happened accidentally, that all being taught, ſome part of it hath not been committed to writing. It is (ſaid he) that in the Old Teſtament God ſhewed a neceſſity of writing it, and therefore writ the <hi>Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue</hi> with his own finger, and laid it up in the Ark, to be kept. In the New, as the Holy Ghoſt did di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the Apoſtles to write and preach the Truth, ſo he did not forbid them to write any thing, and hold
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:93280:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
it in a Myſtery, as in ſome falſe Religions they do. For then how were the Apoſtles Succeſſours able to write that, which was forbidden of God? And if it happened accidentally, that derogates from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God, in directing the Apoſtles to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the New Teſtament. And therefore he thought it not fit to make it an Article of competition againſt the Holy <hi>Scriptures.</hi> Thus reaſoned the Learned <hi>Carmelite,</hi> to whom the Council gave no other but a check, by the mouth of Cardinal <hi>Pool.</hi> But we may reaſon thus: If Holy <hi>Scriptures,</hi> the ſame that we receive as well as they, be the Word of God, as that Council hath decreed, then they are of Divine Authority and Credit ſufficient to be believed for themſelves, and whatſoever they ſay is divine truth; and if ſo, then <hi>Tradition</hi> is clearly caſt out, as uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs or needleſs. For Holy <hi>Scriptures</hi> ſay of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that they are ſufficient and moſt certain: Joh. 20.30, 31. <hi>Jeſus did many more things, but theſe are written that we may believe, and believing may have life through him.</hi> The written Word is ſufficient of it ſelf, Luc. 1.3, 4. <hi>It ſeemed good to write unto thee, that thou mighteſt know the certainty of thoſe things wherein thou art inſtructed.</hi> For <hi>Scripta manent,</hi> and are a certain Rule; when In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions by word of mouth vaniſh, or in time are miſtaken. And it is incredible to imagine, that ſtories for 1600 years, paſſing through ſo many mouths of men, of various Judgments, Tempers, or Affections, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhould not be altered, or corrupted; when we ſee it is ſo, by daily experience, in very ſhort time. <hi>Tradition</hi> now is quite out of doors, caſt out by the Word of God; which will not
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:93280:13"/>
endure the fellowſhip of ſuch an Idol, and Teacher of Lies. And if this main Pillar fail, their whole Religion falls to the ground.</p>

               <p>THe Frier tells me, that the Church of <hi>England,</hi> meaning (ſaith he) the <hi>Prelatical Proteſtants,</hi> is no univerſal, but a particular Sect; no Church or Sect in the world agreeing or communicating with
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:93280:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
it. No, Mr. Frier? The Harmony of Confeſſions tells you what you are; and ſo do many other Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings between us and all the Reformed Churches, full of Kindneſs, Unity and Love, yea between our Doctors and ſome of yours; there were many paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of love and kindneſs paſs'd between your <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> and our learned <hi>Whitaker,</hi> whom the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal had in great eſteem for his great Learning: as every valiant man loves a man of valour, though his enemy. But it hath been long obſerved, that our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Jeſuits, Prieſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are more bitter enemies to our Church, than any Strangers of forreign Parts; as Biſhop <hi>Bramhall</hi> and others, by their own rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion found true by experience, when they were in <hi>France,</hi> during our late Troubles; they found Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers civil and kind, our own very uncivil: here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I conclude our Frier is an <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> by his uncivil language.</p>
               <p>But for a full Reply I ſay, That the Church of Chriſt is Univerſal or Particular; Univerſal abſolute, or reſpective: Abſolutely conſidered, it is the whole company of Believers, of all times and places, elect of God to Salvation in Jeſus Chriſt, called in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, <hi>The Spouſe of Chriſt, Houſhold of God,</hi> &amp;c. In this Church there is no Condemnation, as out of it no Salvation. Or, the <hi>Catholick</hi> Church is taken reſpective, in reſpect of Men, Places, Times, Doctrine, and particular Congregations. Now though the Church of <hi>England</hi> be a particular Church, part of the univerſal, and called, <hi>The Church of</hi> England, from the place where it is ſeated; and the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was no more at the beſt: yet the Church of

                  <hi>England</hi> is Catholick in reſpect of her Doctrine, agreeing with all true Churches, yea with the true Church of <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf. And in this reſpect the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> (now ſo called) is not Catholick, becauſe ſhe is fallen from the true, antient, Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Faith. I have done now with our Friers ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous Libel, charging our Nation with Perjury, which all the Friers in the world will never be able to prove.</p>

               <p>OUr Church is at Unity in it ſelf; and hath no differences, but ſuch as our Adverſaries them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſcatter and cheriſh about in corners, with feigned words deceiving the hearts of the ſimple. The moſt conſiderable party of Diſſenters is not ſo far gone, but may eaſily be reconciled. I know no difference between us, but two words of one ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and one word plainly miſtaken. I ſhould be ſorry to grieve the hearts of any that are truely Godly, and have no other deſigne but to keep a good Conſcience, and to live in the fear of God. I deſire them in love to conſider the diſtracted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of their Native Countrey, and not ſtand upon terms, that have no ground in <hi>Scripture,</hi> whereto the <hi>Covenant</hi> doth no way oblige them, and whereof the Learned <hi>Reformed</hi> of Forreign Churches are quite weary, as they told our Divines at <hi>Dort.</hi>

Other Diſſenters our Adverſaries have ſent, as Pio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niers to undermine us. The moſt troubleſome are <hi>Quakers,</hi> a poor deluded people; but if they would ſpeak directly to ſome few Queſtions, I believe a ſhort Anſwer would ſtop their mouths.</p>

               <p>SUch are all Drunkards, Blaſphemers, Liers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And theſe make the greateſt breach in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all the reſt. I was told once, that all I could ſay, was, that they drew the Judgments of God down upon the Nation. I never thought to hear ſuch an anſwer from the mouth of a Chriſtian. But theſe lewd Livers are the greateſt <hi>Schiſmaticks;</hi> they are a ſcandal to our Church; a ſhame to our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; a reproach to our Nation; bring contempt upon our good Laws and Government. Specially the beaſtly Sin of Drunkenneſs ruines many a hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Youth, brings them to Beggery or worſe; and makes all that uſe it, unſerviceable and unfit for pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick Employment. One good Law, ſuch as our Honourable Parliament hath given an excellent pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of already, would remedy all. Let the bleeding condition of our Neighbours make us beware, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it be too late; Repent of our Sins, leſt our Land mourn too, and the people languiſh for all their Abominations.</p>
